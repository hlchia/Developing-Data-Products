Developing Data Products Project - Vehicle MPG Prediction  
==========================================================

This Shiny App is for predicting vehicle fuel consumption efficiency aka MPG.

The dataset is the ‘mtcars’ dataset, which contains fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models) from the 1974 Motor Trend magazine, to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). 

In my course on regression modeling, using backward selection (“Step Model”) it is shown that 3 aspects of automobile design (weight, 1/4 mile time and transmission) are statistically significant in explaining changes in MPG. The resultant model is used which is: ￼MPG = 9.6178 - 3.9165*wt + 1.2259*qsec + 2.9358*am
